# DE
A data engineer project
In this project, I collected data from the Tiki website using API Endpoint. I also used the Random and Faker libraries to generate some data tables. After the data was transformed and processed, I loaded it into a SQLite database using the SQLite3 library. Next, I designed a data warehouse and created a data pipeline to transfer data from the database to the data warehouse. Finally, I used the Power BI tool to model the data into a dashboard for analysis and research purposes.
